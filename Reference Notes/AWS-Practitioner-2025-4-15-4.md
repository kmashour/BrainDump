AWS Expects 
- operational Excellence through 
	- use automation whenever possible --> 
	  speed , less human intervention = less human errors

	- Monitor and track everything --> track running metrics (CPU,NETWORK,BOTTLENECK,IO)
	
	- Continuous improvement

- Security 
	- Use "least-privilege" access --> each service/user has the least needed privileges to operate (المعرفه علي قدر الاحتياج)
	
	- Use Multifactor Authentication
	
	- Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) --> AWS expects us to use this service to set policies for users 
	
	- Protect data in-transit and at rest --> AWS expects us encrypt data in both states 
	
	- Monitor and Audit continuously
	  Audit : event logs for actions that happens on the system

- Reliability  موثوقيه 
	- Implement Disaster Recovery techniques --> 
	  Design for failure
	
	- Make use of Autoscaling 
	
	- Test and validate regulary --> Try fail over scenario in disaster recovery  

- Performance Efficiency 
	- choose the right tool for the job 
	  Lets we used EBS storage services for storage only while it is designed to able to work with EC2 instances so it was more appropriate to use S3 bucket, using EBS is money waste we didn't fully utilize its function
	
	- Optimize resource utilization and implement scaling --> start with average needed resources and scale when in demand, Cost effective approach.
	
	- user performance benchmarks --> Test the application on different traffic scenarios to have a sense of accurate Resource requirement according to demand and traffic on my app for better performance efficiency (creating a benchmark)

- Cost Optimization 
	- use the right instance type
	
	- use AWS cost saving plans(Reserved Instance , Spot instances)
	
	- monitor and track costs 

- Sustainability   استدامه 
	- Use environment friendly resources 
	- terminate any unused (idle) resources
