# Part 1: Basics & Concepts

## Cloud types:
Using Cloud Servers provide much more efficiency than on-Premises data centers, regarding cost, reliability & time.
### - Public Cloud & Private Cloud
Public cloud is Publicly shared among customers, while Private cloud is for only one customer...
 
So Private cloud is also a CAPEX model like traditional data centers but it comes with the sense of automation and orchestration found in public cloud

cloud = Infrastructure + Automation  + Orchestration (Add and remove services )

![Pasted image 20221109155939](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200851078-db999f92-50f4-4754-b526-a30fc7a2152a.png)

### - Hybrid cloud
A mix between public cloud & on-premises Private Cloud, to provide privacy & security for specific services while the other services are on Public cloud.
- It's a more complex solution as the organization has to manage multiple plat forms.
- Suitable for effectiveness, backup, disaster recovery, development & testing.
### - Multi cloud
The use of multiple & different cloud computing & storage services in a single structure. Mostly because some services are better in each cloud provider than others for a specific use.
### - Hybrid Multi Cloud
Using Hybrid cloud concept but with multiple vendors and a On premise all of that is connected. 

## "Automation & Orchestration" Concept
- Automation concept is making the cloud processes automatic, like deployment, provisioning, upgrading, testing, etc.
- Orchestration concept is the idea of expanding your infrastructure.
## "Vendor lock-in" Concept
Using a specific cloud vendor in a major way & concentrating on its services makes it difficult to move to another vendor if required.
Vendor lock-in is using cloud formation EKS instead of terraform and kubernetes which can be used with any cloud provider 

## AWS Cloud Services
![Pasted image 20221016203143](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200851567-a14762b4-7de7-4781-a033-4b74541c12f2.png)



## AWS Global presence 
8th of May 2025 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250508114815.png]]


## IAM - Identity & Access Management
IAM allows creating & managing multiple identities, authentication & authorization for AWS account.
So The same AWS account can have multiple users with different permissions, instead of only logging in as a ROOT User
### IAM Features:
- Shared access to AWS account
- Granular Permissions:
	Specific & strict permissions as desired.
- Secure access to AWS resources for applications that runs on AWS 
- Multi-factor authentication
- Identity Federation:
	The process of delegating a user authentication responsibility to a trusted external party. *ex:* Logging in by google authentication.
-  identity information logs
- PCI Compliance:
	Credit Card Compliance.
- Integrated with many AWS Services
- Eventually Consistent details & permissions 
	(IAM sticks with the user regardless his geolocation or the AWS  region he is operating in)
- Free to use
- AWS STS "AWS Secure Token Service":
	Temporary Sessions.



### IAM Identities
- Federated Users (outside AWS)
- IAM User
- IAM Group
- IAM Role:
	IAM Role is a set of permissions, acts as a badge for a determined temporary time "STS - Security Token Service".

### IAM Console
### *_USERS:*

### Creating IAM User :
![Pasted image 20221019205435](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200852774-85c5e4d5-eef3-4ce5-bd19-b214dd05be7e.png)

### Setting Permissions or adding the user to a Group :
![Pasted image 20221019224718](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200853212-ea5ee1db-edfe-4781-9b56-668829901943.png)
### User details
![ezgif com-gif-maker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/201072140-3fda1335-eda2-4cfa-bad3-67ec2ecbb131.gif)
### Access Key
- A secret key that is download as .csv file, to login using it instead of username & password.
- If the access key or the file is lost, the access can be denied from the console, by selecting status to inactive.
![Pasted image 20221020014900](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200855856-2b1660ce-ec28-4190-9f75-5929b43136b6.png)

### *_ACCOUNT SETTINGS:*

### Password Policy
Having restrictions over passwords in the system
![Pasted image 20221020015357](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200855949-dab439c2-4ea5-4429-aa60-c8d9bd49ad10.png)
![Pasted image 20221020015627](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200856160-2c05dff0-7e09-4c78-81a7-dfb8f0473af3.png)
*Note:* When applying a new password policy, only new users will be affected, & the old users will only be affected after password expiry "Enable passwords expiration".

### IAM Best Practice

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250508134144.png]]

![Pasted image 20221020232823](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200856466-5ba41a25-b03d-4a30-90b4-052604d218dc.png)
 
## Creating Billing Alarms
Using the Root User, limiting bills to as low as 1$ & setting Billing alarms can be done through the Budgets tab in the Billing Dashboard.
This can be set to be a continuous **"Recurring budget"** or an **"Expiring Budget"**.
This is very important step to avoid unexpected bills over the budget plan.

## VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
- The Virtual Private Cloud, is a virtual data center in the cloud, confined to an AWS region & isolated from other VPCs by default.
management- The client has full control over his VPC & is secured from other clients with other VPCs on the same AWS host server.
- A VPC is confined to a single AWS Region

#AWS-VPC-SCOPE
VPC is a regional service 
You don't get charged over VPC creation (igw,vgw,subnets)
### VPC Components  
- ##### CIDR Block
	- Each created VPC has  a main CIDR Block created with it & this main cannot be removed or changed, only the VPC can be totally deleted.
	- **VPC Address Pool can be expanded by adding up to 4 secondary CIDR Blocks, with some limitations.**                  secondary CIDR  == Expansion CIDR
	- When Connecting to another VPC subnets or on premise if the same CIDR range is used it creates a problem but it can be worked around it 

- ##### Subnets
	- Multiple subnets can be configured per VPC.
	- subnets can't be overlapping and that is a basic TCP/IP restriction subnets are confined in a *Availability Zone*, *meaning they cannot stretch between multiple AZs.* 
	- Subnets can only attach to one route table at a time 

	--if i tried stretching a subnet over two AZ is not recommended because it causes troubles like broadcast problems ??-- 

- ##### Implied Router
	- AWS provides an implied virtual router for the VPC, connecting all subnets to one another. This router is accessible or manageable  only by AWS not the client.

     We can Control Implied Router behavior but thats not in the associate level 

- ##### Route Tables
    - The client only edits the routing tables provided by the Implied Router
    - Route table can be used by more than one subnet 

	Routing inside a VPC is guaranteed by default and it can't be changed or removed 

#AWS-ROUTE-TABLE-SCOPE
Subnet level 

 - ##### Internet Gateway "IGW"
	 Default VPCs are automatically assigned with Internet Gateway, created new VPCs doesn't & must be assigned to an Internet Gateway Manually .
	 Internet Gateway is fully managed by AWS not the client, horizontally scaled, redundant & highly available, & supports IPv4 & IPv6.
	 **Only one IGW can be assigned to a VPC at a time.**
	- ##### Virtual Private Gateway "VGW"
	  An encrypted (VPN-IPsec) Gateway over the internet **(can be affected by network latency)** to establish connection to On-Premise with the cloud "For Hybrid Clouds".
	  Only one VGW can be assigned to a VPC at a time.
- ##### Security Groups
- ##### Network Access Control Lists "Network ACL"
![Pasted image 20221025014904](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200856677-0264d399-5873-4213-a96f-029d700de759.png)
### VPC Console
By default there will a VPC on each region, this can be viewed from the VPC dashboard. 
From the VPC Console You can manage & view the info of current VPCs or create new VPCs, & manage all the VPC components listed before.
![Pasted image 20221024230911](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200856768-a6fb0c84-0b09-42a5-a9b5-cddc7a060af1.png)

## Public Subnet vs Private Subnet
### Public Subnet 
Is a subnet created in a VPC with IGW attached and its associated routing table contains a default route pointing at the VPC's IGW, 
meaning it has internet access. 
Public Subnets is used for the applications & services that will need internet access
### private subnets 
doesn't have internet access. They can't access the internet directly and can't be accessed from outside the VPC,*Private Subnets is mainly for databases*, Private subnets is sometimes even used for application that need internet access for extra security so it will access the internet indirectly   


![Pasted image 20221031004509](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200856868-6a73eec2-b1b4-4fe3-b9a2-51e7f8099f82.png)

## Hybrid Cloud Connectivity Options in AWS
##### 1- VPN Connection
- Not reliable
- Over the internet connection
- Quick to deploy
- Secure
- Cost effective
##### 2- AWS Direct Connect Connection "DX"
- Long deployment times
- Reliable good performance
- Not secure by default as VPN Connection
*Note:* It's applicable to use "IPSec"/VPN on top of the DX to get the benefits of the DX with more reliable security.
Both Connections above are terminated on the "VGW" from the VPC end, & on the Customer Gateway from the On-Premises end.
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250508151826.png]]
## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
EC2 is a service acting as Virtual Machines, with resizable computing capacity in the cloud, & fully manageable by the client with the root access.
EC2 can be provisioned on **shared hosts** (Between other AWS Client's EC2 instances) or **dedicated hosts**. There is a 20 EC2 instances soft limit per account. {{Soft limits is limits that can be changed, opposite of Hard Limits}}
EC2 is launched in a subnet in the availability zone.

### EC2 Instances Types:

#AWS-EBS-SCOPE
The availability zone 
Can only be used by one EC2 
##### 1- EBS Volumes - Elastic Block Store
- EBS volumes are volumes that keeps the data persistent & not lost after turning off the EC2.
- The EBS Volumes are always outside the EC2 instance but **in the same availability zone.**
- The EC2 EBS volume holding the data is reached through ENI (eth0) as its not on EC2 its a storage over the network in the AZ.
- EC2 instances with an EBS root volume are called **EBS-Backed EC2 Instances.**
##### 2- Instance-Store
- Also known as ephemeral Storage, these volumes are in the same physical server as the EC2, & are not persistent.
- Access to Instance-store volumes are much faster than EBS Volume.
- EC2 instances with an instance-store volume are called Instance-Store Backed EC2 Instances. sometime we want the high IO operations so we make distributed system for high availability will be covered later in the course  

### EC2 SSH Keys
- No Password needed for login, only 2 Keys Pairs
- Public key is stored in AWS, Private key is a key the client keeps.
- The Private key is downloaded only at instance creation, if not or lost the instance should be terminated & start a new one.
### Methods of Connection
##### 1- SSH - Secure Shell Login for EC2 instances
##### 2- EC2 Instance Connect "Browser Based SSH Connection"

###### EC2 connecting by SSH client steps are shown in the console after trying to connect:
![Pasted image 20221031012059](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200857121-427a5bf5-ea49-4a1c-a9c6-dc11dd727afd.png)
![Pasted image 20221031012400](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200857171-dc7050f2-83b0-498e-a5cb-21df72a4573a.png)
*Note:* instead of typing the SSH key in the command, use the option -K for storing it in memory & option -A for the agent forwarding. 
![Pasted image 20221111065442](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/201266337-b006c88e-0e45-4632-b8db-4095ad3e4720.png)

### Private, Public & Elastic IP Addresses 
![Pasted image 20221031014312](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200857220-2cb7281b-5258-439a-97f0-d2ef243fde0b.png)


> [!NOTE] Title
> EIP has a soft limit of 5 per VPC "Can be changed by sending a ticket"



### NAT - Network Address Translation.
**No EC2 instance will launch without having a Private IP Address.** However it needs either Public IP Address or Elastic IP Address to simply be able to connect to it, as the EC2 is logged onto through the internet as every AWS service.
The EC2 Private IP Address is translated to its corresponding Public IP Address by NAT - Network Address Translation.
![Pasted image 20221031014808](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200857316-159c1a72-19ee-44a3-afb3-e9a5a1bbdd66.png)

### Elastic Ip Address
EIP is mostly used to hold a specific IP for firewalls, so it is referred to as **whitelisting**, The whitelisting term is used when we want to configure a firewall to IPs so we want fixed IPs so we don't reconfigure the firewall if the instances is restarted 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509093622.png]]
.

### Monolithic vs Multi Tier, & Microservices
Monolithic is using one instance for the whole application & the entire application is built as a single code project, making it harder to scale & troubleshoot. It's more advisable to use multi tier instances for multiple parts of the project or the application.
![Pasted image 20221103010515](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200857450-e74b170d-9773-4cea-a7f8-5d19f298b6d5.png)
Microservices approach is dividing the tiers even more to be able to launch it on containers instead of VMs, as it's has more efficiency & speed.
![Pasted image 20221103041823](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200857510-5c6185df-2b3a-4976-a22f-bdaf49a0d814.png)

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250512091001.png]]
## Security Groups
- Security Groups are virtual firewalls applied on the ENI "Elastic Network Interface" of the EC2 instance.
- Traffic going into the ENI is called inbound traffic, & traffic from the ENI is called outbound traffic. 
- Security Groups have only permit rules. no deny rules. If no permits are found it is considered as an implied deny.
- Can add up to 16 (5 default maximum) Security Groups per EC2 instance.
- Security Groups are stateful, meaning that if the traffic is allowed either if its inbound or outbound, the opposite direction response is automatically allowed even if no permit rules were found.
![Pasted image 20221031231048](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858159-50800cf5-62a4-461b-a96e-eb1f2da305ca.png)

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509095045.png]]

#AWS-SECURITYGROUP-SCOPE
On EC2 level and it can 
be connected to multiple EC2 
in **same region** ?
### Source & Destination Ports
Security Groups are basically settings for sources & destinations.
**vip.note:** Ephemeral Range is the set of ports of the client.
![Pasted image 20221031233103](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858227-51a75904-2042-49d5-af92-bc7fe4b76c3c.png)
*Example:* In a working environment you want the SSH Logins to only be able to occur from a set of specific IPs
![Pasted image 20221031233719](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858305-7b2d9a8b-e39e-4793-acf9-ea3f8c6b25bd.png)

## NACLs - Network Access Control Lists
- NACL functions at a subnet level, so it's applied to all EC2 instances inside the subnet.
- It's applied at the implied router
- NACLs are **Stateless** "one way only".
- It includes permit & deny rules.
- Each NACL rule has a sequence number, rules are elevated from lowest to highest sequence number.
- Once a rule is found either permit or deny the process is stopped "no reading for rest of the rules", if none are found it ends with explicit deny.
- Traffic going into Subnet is called inbound traffic, & traffic from the Subnet is called outbound traffic.

**Security Group Vs NACL, NACL is applied to all EC2 inside the subnet**
![Pasted image 20221101011630](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858369-1960439d-6b59-4b0e-b91d-a6c24b584bb6.png)

![Pasted image 20221101010350](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858473-8400953f-d06d-48d9-88b3-bb090e1147bd.png)
*Note:* As Network ACL acts on the Subnet not the VPC, **its Dashboard is on the VPC Dashboard,** unlike the security groups which is on the EC2 Dashboard.

#AWS-NACL-SCOPE
subnet level 

### Whitelisting vs Blacklisting 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509101613.png]]

custom NACL by default is black listed deny all traffic and by adding rules we are whitelisting, Default NACL allow inbound and outbound 

In outbound traffic the source will be a port of the ephemeral range that the client may be using so we need to set the range of the outbound rules same as the ephemeral range 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509102806.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509102735.png]]


## Encryption
It's basically locking sensitive data or over network packets to prevent leakage of sensitive information, this locking is done with encryption keys of different kinds.

Its always better to know in the design phase if i want to apply encryption on my S3 buckets or RDS for example before creating my architecture and it can be added later but in terms of best practices its better before 

### 1- Encryption in-Transit using Asymmetric Keys
- Encryption between two ends, using a Public key & a Private key.
- Requires Key generator to create the key pair.
- The key owner holds the private key & shares the public key with clients.
**ie:** Owner encrypts with the private key & the client decrypts with the public key, & vice versa.

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509104728.png]] 

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509105033.png]]
### 2- Encryption in-Transit using Symmetric Keys
- Uses the same key & encryption algorithm for encryption/decryption.
- It's more efficient than using the asymmetric key.
- The asymmetric encryption can be used to exchange symmetric keys.
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509105447.png]]
### KMS - AWS Key Management Services [[AWS-KMS]]
It's an *AWS managed* Key management service that allows customers to **create & manage cryptographic keys.**
- Controls keys usage & permissions for keys' access.
- integrated with many AWS services.
- Highly durable "Low loss" & highly available.
- Integrated with CloudTrail(Audit services).
- It's a Regional service, meaning that created keys in RegionA will only work for RegionA, although the VPC is over multiple regions.
- **$1/Month for each key customer created, or free for keys created by AWS services.**
- CMKs - Customer Master Keys are the primary resources in the KMS.

#AWS-KMS-SCOPE
Regional scope only on the region it was created 
#### CMKs - Customer Master Keys

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509110017.png]]

- CMKs are used to provide either encrypted keys or plain keys.
- KMS provides encrypting data up to 4 Kbytes, bigger files require manual encrypting using CMKs generated keys.
- **CMKs never leave KMS.**
- KMS doesn't store customer **data keys** generated by CMKs, **either encrypted or not.**
- The encrypted Key held by customer can be sent to KMS to decrypt it to plain text again to be able to use it for decryption.
- There are both AWS-managed CMKs, or Customer-Managed CMKs



![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509110718.png]]


Here we used the plain text Datakey for decryption and then discarded it... and stored the encrypted Datakey 

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509110745.png]]

Since i stored my encrypted Datakey I will use KMS to decrypt the Datakey to plain text so it could be used to decrypt the data

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509110941.png]]


![Pasted image 20221101053243](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858572-6bcdb521-0a49-47c3-ad5f-bd40c0b8de86.png)
Note: So how can i differentiate between Keys managed by AWS and customer managed keys, **AWS keys are known by the name of** *aws/service_name* 

**Example:** creating an EC2 instance & encrypting EBS Volume:
![Pasted image 20221101054012](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858659-e183d1f7-f56d-43df-b2bd-fbb2a354adcb.png)
**Note:**  AWS-managed CMKs have automatic key rotation of 3 years, while Customer-Managed CMKs have 1-year optional rotational period "If Chosen".

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509111142.png]]
## AWS S3 -Simple Storage Service / Object Storage
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250509113404.png]]
- It's Object Storage based, Data & Meta-Data stored as whole object & not divided into objects "as in Block Storage".
- Cheaper than Block Storage "as EBS Volumes"
- Better scalability & durability.
- **Cannot be mounted as a drive or a directory to an EC2 instance. it can only be accessed through API's** 
- Ideal for data growth storage as there is no limit on amount of data or metadata in an object, only the maximum size of a file is 5 Terabyte
- S3 Storages are called S3 Buckets, & the Buckets are confined to the Region & outside the VPC, **backing up it to another regions must be done manually**. since its outside the VPC NACL and security groups are not applied to it 
- The S3 Buckets' names are Globally Unique.
- There are no actual folders within a bucket, however this can be mimicked and attach a folder name to objects for work organization.
![Pasted image 20221101060601](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858734-a6ce799d-7255-4082-a80d-2a4d0d7f4c13.png)

#AWS-S3-SCOPE
Regional scope 
## Programmatic Access to AWS
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250510230133.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250510230152.png]]


Programmatic access for any IAM user isn't done by username & password, it requires an access key (Access Key ID & Secret Access Key) to access AWS Programmatically "**ex:** the windows cmd".
- The Secret Access Key is only shown at creation & must be saved. 
**Note:** Make sure you have AWS CLI installed on your OS terminal.
![Pasted image 20221101202112](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858809-40d52a10-497f-4cf8-b91c-8fc7c6e0dc9e.png)
**Logging in by programmatic access using the log in keys:**
![Pasted image 20221102110038](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200858939-c5314e77-350c-4ced-bf86-1329bda8fe63.png)

## IAM Policies

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250510231341.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250510231545.png]]


![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250510232036.png]]

- it's attached to an identity "IAM user, IAM role, etc." or a resource "item in a S3 Bucket".
- Policies are AWS-Managed, Customer-Managed, or inline Policy "for one user".
- More than one policy may be attached to an identity.
- By default all requests are denied for an identity, an explicit allow overrides this.
- an explicit deny overrides all allows.
- Policies are stored as JSON documents in AWS.


![Pasted image 20221102233310](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200859226-fd4774c1-acc6-4a1d-8b45-1ac2bac1e58e.png)

### EC2 Instance IAM Role 

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250510233120.png]]


IAM Role **is not permanent** (long term credentials) the provided token doesn't last forever its only available for a predefined time  
**Don't** use permanent credentials inside an EC2 instance or in a code instead use an IAM Roles

**AN IAM ROLE IS AN STS (security token service)**






## SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Message Queue Concept)
- Message Queues provide asynchronous communication & coordination for the application components.
- Messages are stored in queue reliably until they re processed, then get deleted.
- this allows scaling different parts of the project (Producer queue and consumer queue) because they are independent of each other  & increase its reliability.
- Message sending Tiers is called **Message** **Producers**, while message receiving Tiers is called **Message Consumers**.
- Using SQS is referred to as Decoupling process, as it decouples different tiers. 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250510235011.png]]


## SNS - Amazon Simple Notification Service
- SNS is a fast & fully managed notification service.
- **Publisher is the sender "Producer" & Subscriber is the receiver "Consumer".**
- Publishers publish messages to a SNS Topic, Subscribers receive messages from the SNS Topics they are subscribed to.
- **Publisher must have the permissions to be in the SNS Topic "IAM Policies".**
- Subscribers can be users, emails, SMS, services & many other formats.
- SNS is reliable & stores multiple data copies across multiple AZs.
- SNS supports HTTPS in-transit. Its also encrypted at rest 
![Pasted image 20221103014434](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200859449-f4fb80d3-3c56-4e0f-8234-26952278915b.png)
**Note:** Message size in SQS & SNS shouldn't exceed 256 Kbytes, indicating that the messages either in queue "SQS" or instant "SNS" won't include the data or the object itself, only a message about the data.

## CDN - Content Delivery Network (Amazon CloudFront)
- Amazon CloudFront Provides highly available cache to compensate using multiple resources for less latency "**ex:** Accessing data from S3 buckets through different countries"
- using CloudFront is more economically efficient than using different Buckets.
- These Cache Locations are called Edge Locations.
![Pasted image 20221103030233](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200859517-5740e0c2-2478-4a47-9fc4-df78dd78be47.png)


Red squares refers to edge locations, if edge locations doesn't have the requested data cached it uses its high speed links to the main s3 bucket source and fetch the data so the fetch process was faster than the user connecting directly to the s3 and if the data was requested again its already cached in the edge location 

Using Cloud-Front is guaranteed to be cheaper than fetching content directly from an s3 bucket, can be a question on how to reduce s3 bucket cost usage 


## Amazon Route 53 

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250511004319.png]]

![Pasted image 20221103032121](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200859583-e324ab9d-6d2a-4a78-ae6d-e2d24956b668.png)
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250511003916.png]]

- Amazon Route 53 is AWS's DNS.
- Acts similar to the Public DNS for example.
- It supports public hosted zones for internet facing workload/applications, or private hosed zones for private workloads/on VPC applications.
- The Firms or corporate that has a Domain name server (Route 53) They have a pool of Ip addresses mapped to names all they do wait for a request on that domain name and reply with the IP 
	- AWS is the authoritative of any domain name it holds, Internet registry any domain name registered in it is unique globally 
	- Record Means Which domain resolves to what ip address

## OLTP & OLAP
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250511005627.png]]
#### OLTP - On-Line Transactional Processing
- Uses detailed & Current data to store the transactional data
- Characterized by high volume of simple transactions & short queries.
#### OLAP - On-Line Analytical  Processing
- Stores analytical data & reports
- Characterized by relatively low transactions volume & very complex queries involving aggregations.

## RDS - Amazon Relational Database Service 
- it supports a set of databases services as MS SQL, MySQL, Maria DB, Oracle, PostgreSQL & Amazon Aurora.
- **RDS Launches the database inside the (VPC).**
- It's advised to be put inside a private subnet.
- RDS is fully managed Database, so no customer or root access to it by default.
- If I want root access to RDS instance control, it's  available to use EC2 instances for a self-managed database.
- A **security group** can be attached to the RDS database. **its a best practice to only allow backend tier traffic to pass to the database** 
- RDS instance can be launched in a standalone mode "single AZ" or Multi-AZ mode (Primary instances for read/write & **Standby RDS instances for instant data replication only**).
	- standby is fully synced with the primary RDS, so in real time any data in Primary will be in the standby but it can't read/write unless something happened to the primary and **this process is fully managed by AWS**, AWS provide a URL for developer the URL redirect the request to the up and running database 
- If Iam using RDS in multi-AZ mode when we use the provided URL it uses private hosted route 53 so the URL resolves to the healthy RDS **whether its the Primary or the stand by all the is AWS managed** 
- **It supports auto scaling.**

## High Availability & Fault Tolerance
- **High availability** describes the **availability of the application**, **while Fault tolerance** describes how much the application **performance is affected by faults**.
- High availability is done by **Load Balancers.** through periodic health check the load balancer forward the traffic to healthy EC2 instances, The health check as threshold if it was exceeded the EC2 is marked out of service and unhealthy 

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250512091313.png]]

- Highly available but not fault tolarent 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250512091336.png]]

- **Higher Fault tolerance** means higher cost, due to increase of resources. If the application didn't react in real time in fault scenarios the application will not be considered fault tolerance 
![Pasted image 20221103042616](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200859632-0ad6166f-a411-4e40-9088-8b4c2930742d.png)

## Scalability & Elasticity
### Scalability 
- Scalability refers to system's ability to handle the growth of load by adding resources.
- This scaling can be vertical scaling (up/down) or horizontal scaling(out/in).
 ![Pasted image 20221103043119](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200859709-cc84e90c-9afd-4851-90fa-87e2878137ac.png)
### Elasticity 
  
- Elasticity describes the system ability to provision &  deprovision resources **automatically** to ensure that resources matches the need. 
- **Auto scaling groups can be configured for EC2 instances**, There  are another auto scaling type called Application Autoscaling will be covered later 
- **Autoscaling is always accompanied with load balancer** in design to ensure high availability  

> [!NOTE]
> - Remember we need to take in consideration the time need for horizontal scaling to start executing it needs triggers from cloud watch and autoscaling groups health checks then start in creating the EC2 instances and EC2 instance may need Minutes to initialize so if it was a 1 min spike in traffic, The application has failed to be fault tolerant we tackle more of this in later videos  

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250512092901.png]]

## CloudWatch
- CloudWatch is the center of real time monitoring & visibility in AWS.
- It's a metric data repository "per resource".
- Has the ability to add a custom metric.
- Provides statistics & logs.
- Monitors alarms can be set & can trigger actions
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250512103020.png]]
## CloudTrail
- Any actions "APIs" taken by IAM users, roles or AWS services are recorded in CloudTrail.
- Events can be viewed & downloaded.
- It helps in governance & auditing the account.
- Events history are maintained for 90 days.
- Logs can be stored in a S3 Bucket for more than 90 days if desired, **this is encrypted by default.**
- CloudTrail is integrated with SNS.
- A trail created in the console is a multi-region trail, use the command interface to make a region trail.
  so Console cloud trail is multi-region scope
  And CLI if I want to make a single region trail 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250512103915.png]]
### Logs Events types
#### 1- Management event
- Provide visibility into management & operations on resources.
- Free of charge.
- Enabled  by default.
#### 2- Data event 
- Provide visibility into resource level operations "objects in a bucket".
- Chargeable.
- Disabled by default.
#### 3- Insights Events
- Logs events for unusual API write activates in the account.
- Chargeable.
- Disabled by default.

### Log File Integrity Validation
- The ability of CloudTrail to determine whether a log file was modified, changed or deleted after delivering the logs to an S3 Bucket.
- This is beneficial in forensics investigations.
- Using a validation log file, you can accurately determine whether a log file was changed or not, & **if so shows the user credentials involved in this activity.**
- **This is done by creating a hash for every log file delivered.**

## Disaster Recovery - RPO & RTO

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516105714.png]]

- #### RPO - Recovery Point Objective
RPO is the acceptable data to be lost after the restoration point "Backup point" due to a disaster. Measured in time (hours / minutes / seconds)
- #### RTO - Recovery Time Objective
RTO is the acceptable time taken after the disaster to get active again & go back to last restoration point taken.
- RPO & RTO determines the cost of Disaster Recovery, less RPO & RTO means more cost with more efficient Disaster Recovery.
![Pasted image 20221109072525](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/200859792-7bc9d1b9-29e9-4bd4-885e-c7f6424986fe.png)
AWS Approach in Disaster Recovery could be explained as having a DR Site for disaster recovery, & it should be in a different region or away form the main production site. If the production went down, the cloud service is redirected to the DR Site, & it's advised to be automated redirection. 

The RTO and RPO is determined after making a business analysis to determine how much should we invest in a disaster recovery plans   

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516110610.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516110618.png]]
### Disaster Recovery Approaches
Graded from lower cost & recovery speed to the higher cost & fast recovery speed as follows : 
##### 1- Backup & Restore
- Copies AMIs & backup data & store it in a different region.
- no active DR sites until the disaster happens.
##### 2- Pilot Light
- Keep the minimal needs of the infrastructure only "**ex:** Databases".
- Continuous data replication between the two sites.
##### 3- Warm Standby
- Keep a scaled down version of the production environment.
- The second site can be scaled up after the disaster if needed.
##### 4- Multi Site
- Keep full running version of the production environment.
- Active/Active Sites.

# Part 2: VPC Deep Dive
----------
## My take on the 1st hour
#### VPC Recap

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516113120.png]]

If i want to make a patch updates in the private network i need to download but the private subnet is completely isolated it can't even access s3 buckets since they are a accessed trough a public endpoint so a private subnet can't access it also even if its an aws resource 

I can't add a gateway route in the **route table** to the IGW since its a private subnet this will be out of sense 
#### Using a NAT instance:

So we used a NAT instance as a mediator a broker between public internet and private subnet 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516114836.png]]

- Remember any http communication the source chooses a port from the ephemeral range of ports 

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516115220.png]]


#### NAT Gateway 

The NAT instance is not a fully managed service by aws and its a single point of failure.
We can apply multiple Instance for HA and to be redundant and start manually to configure route table of different private subnets on my NAT instances so its a bit of hassle on top of that  it will cost.

so why not just use a **NAT Gateway**

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516120635.png]]


### High availability architecture 

Remember that the HA and redundancy is applied on the NAT gateway itself as a resource, but it can't be stretched on multiple AZ so we create on NAT Gate way in each AZ and it servers the private subnets under that AZ thats how the architecture it self is HA and redundant so is the NAT Gateway   

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516121047.png]]



#### NAT Instance vs NAT Gateway 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516121547.png]]

----






---------------

## NAT Deep Dive & NAT services
Suppose a scenario of which the EC2 in a private instance & need to update its data from an S3 Bucket, the bucket is accessible by a public IP (it has public endpoint) on the internet, & same goes for all of AWS Services. As the EC2 is in a private subnet it won't be able to connect to the S3 to get the update unless changed to a public subnet, removing the purpose which the EC2 is in a private subnet in the first place.. so the solution is refused.
There are two NAT Services that can fix the issue proposed:
#### 1- NAT Instance
- Its an EC2 instance AMI (Amazon Machine Image), so it's fully managed & secured by the client.
- NAT instance is launched in a public subnet.
- The routing table of the private subnet requiring internet access should be given a default route pointing to the NAT Instance ID
- The NAT instance has a translation table, having the source/destination IP & port, as well as the mapping IP & port.
- All Ports in the translation table are from the ephemeral range.
- The instance is given private or elastic IP address.
- The Mapping IP is the translated public IP in the NAT translation table of the Private/Elastic IP Address in the public subnet.
![Pasted image 20221110134611](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204100897-a689250c-5232-4226-ba0c-8676bb81b2e9.png)
#### 2- NAT Gateway
- NAT Gateway is a fully managed highly available service, scaling by up to 45 Gbps per gateway.
- NAT Gateways work only with Elastic IP Addresses.
- It cannot be associated with a security group.
- More preferred than instances due to its high availability.
- Although it's highly available, but it exists only in one availability zone.
![Pasted image 20221110134611](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204100927-adc7e210-278b-4f18-9ee1-01c0f2cf8966.png)
#### AZ Independent Architecture For High Availability
Multiple NAT Gateways are deployed over multiple Availability Zones "one per each", & have the route table of the private subnets in each AZ to its NAT Gateway.
So if a NAT Gateway went down the routing table redirects the packet to the other NAT Gateway in another AZ in the same network, & if an AZ went down, the other NAT Gateways keep functioning.
![Pasted image 20221110144124](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204100940-24c8b5b4-fabf-4cd6-92f0-4e578c278c28.png)
#### How they work:
The packet goes from the private subnet to the NAT instance/NAT Gateway in the public subnet, which redirects it to the IGW with a new public IP from the translation table in the IGW, sending it over the internet.

![Pasted image 20221110144738](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204100950-926f1638-67f8-4e06-93b3-84bbee21b5ee.png)

#### Console Applications:
###### 1- Creating NAT Instance
- Create an ordinary EC2 instance, with a NAT instance image which can be found in **Community AMIs**. 
- Make sure to add HTTP & HTTPS ports to the security group if it will be needed.
- **A very important note** when creating a NAT instance is **disabling the Source/Destination Check**. This is because by default the EC2 instance can  work as a source or a distention but not as an intermediate stage, this is controlled by the Source/Destination Check.

![Pasted image 20221111063112](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204100954-f63dcd97-e914-42cd-8849-2316d47fc8fe.png)
###### 2- Logging in to a Private Subnet's EC2 Instance using NAT Instance
- A private Subnet doesn't have internet access, so you can't access it remotely.
- To log in to a private subnet, log in to a NAT public instance & log in to the private one from it.
- Remember to add the NAT ID to the private subnet route table, with destination 0.0.0.0/0
- Access the Public EC2 instance then the Private one
- Use command   to set if the instance will update or not, to test connectivity.
![Pasted image 20221111073339](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204100966-cdc8b13a-ae18-4f6e-a83f-7b9c486ae0c9.png)
###### 3- Creating NAT Gateway
- Created from the VPC Console
- Created with an Elastic IP Address
- No Source/Destination Check, No Security Groups, etc.. As it's an AWS fully managed service
###### 4- Logging in to a Private Subnet's EC2 Instance using NAT Gateway
- Same as before, but instead of adding NAT Instance ID in the target in the routing table, add NAT Gateway ID with destination 0.0.0.0/0

***Notice that*** using the NAT Instance or NAT Gateway for accessing the private subnet made us allow SSH Port for accessing it. Despite this technique working properly, its not preferred in a production environment as the NAT shouldn't get SSH requests to access it, meaning that we should remove the SSH Port from  NAT Instance, & you can't SSH request on a NAT Gateway anyways.
	*What is the alternative?* Bastion Host

gateway of last resort --> when we add an entry in a route table which is 0.0.0.0/24, as when you don't know where to route use this entry 
black hauling --> when i delete a instance or an endpoint that was used in a route table the route table entry becomes a black hauling

### Bastion Host
it's an EC2 instance with no applications, allowing SSH(22) "for Linux Bastion" or RDP(3389) "for Windows Bastion", & it has all required security applications. Bastion Host is the ONLY way to access the subnets from the internet.
Thus It's a regular EC2 Instance with Security Hardening "Strict & Heavy security" created & set by you. ***BASTION HOST IS NOT A SERVICE!***


- Bastion Hosts are launched in Public subnets
- You can set the Bastion Host to only allow SSH or RDP from the corporate IP Addresses range **instead of any remote access**, this is done from the **Bastion Host Security Group or NACL in case** the subnet **only contains bastion hosts**, if the subnet has other instances or a NAT gateway we will apply the security on just the bastion instance (security group) because the NACL will also block the NAT gateway and other instances traffic 
- **Remote accessing** can be done by using a remote desktop, so the **admins log in from home to the remote desktop in corporate**, & then **to the Bastion Host**.So its recommended for a **bastion host** to have **an elastic ip** so it doesn't change unless I manually release the IP
- Once Iam inside the VPC through Bastion I can even access private subnets since Iam using the private VPC network unless i deny it explicitly in security groups or the NACL  
- For high availability, multiple Bastion Hosts can be set across different subnets & apply auto-scaling between them.
- Bastion Hosts are used only for accessing the subnets, & not sending from inside a subnet to the internet. AWS recommends NAT Gateways for outgoing requests.
![Pasted image 20221124215306](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204100980-5b73c8c3-aa98-414f-acd9-3cfdb5316bcc.png)

## Proxy Server
- Proxy Servers are used for **URL Filtering**
- Created in Public Subnets
- It's created in the EC2 instance & works similar to NAT Instances
- If an EC2 in a private subnet required Proxy servers, the Proxy is initiated in a public subnet & the redirection happens similar to how NAT Instances did.
## Reverse Proxy Server
it is a service that is used for **caching**. When accessing the application/website linked with a Reverse Proxy, **the URL resolves to the R-proxy**, **filtering the traffic & then sending it to the application server**, & **it deals with the response from the application server** **the same way**, **caching the operation. So if the same request came again, it will respond automatically as it's cached.**

## Connecting VPCs together 
### VPC Peering
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516193947.png]]

By default, VPCs cannot communicate directly with each other without using internet access(No Network between them). 
VPC Peering connection allows routing between two VPCs.
- Highly available & fully managed by AWS.
- The two VPCs can be from the same account or different account, & they can be in the same AWS region or not.
- The two VPCs cannot have overlapping CIDR ranges "not even in one subnet".
- Subnets routing tables must be edited & have the new VPC range added to it.
- The routing tables contain the CIDR Block Network Range.


![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516194210.png]]
- Transitive Peering is not allowed "No intermediate routing to VPCs".



![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516194416.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516194453.png]]

- No Edge to Edge Routing "No intermediate routing to VPN/Direct connections".

![Pasted image 20221125215929](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204100991-2233a5dd-1cfc-49fa-a671-f32a635c4566.png)
*Note :* For any to any connection, the no. of required peering connections is N(N-1)/2

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516194758.png]]

### AWS Transit Gateway
Upon increasing the no. of VPCs required to be connected together, more VPC Peering connections are required, & if on-premises is to be connected to the VPCs, no. of VPNs & DX will increase as will.
Here comes the use of Transit Gateway, as it can simplify communication requirements as the VPCs grow.


![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516195320.png]]
- **Regional resource.**
- Highly available & fully managed by AWS.
- Supports IPv4 & IPv6
- VPCs cannot have overlapping CIDR ranges "not even in one subnet".
- It allows intermediate routing through editable routing tables.
- If multiple regions is to be connected, a transit gateway peering can take place between the two AWS Transit Gateways.
- The routing tables contain the Subnets IP Addresses.


![Pasted image 20221125225925](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204101019-8cfadba7-6561-4fb0-a4b2-a294904e4089.png)
*Note:* Remember to edit the routing table either when using peering connection or Transit Gateway, setting each of them as the destination.

### VPC Peering & Transit Gateway in Console
##### 1- Peering Connection
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516200245.png]]
- Check that the security groups & NACLs allow the connection & Ping Request.
- Upon creating Peering connection, the other VPC will get a pending request to accept or refuse.
- The peering connection request is accepted from the *Peering connection* table.
- After this step, if you tried to ping, time out will occur as the routing table is not set up yet.
- In the routing table, make sure to set the *Destination* as the other CIDR Network, & the *Target* as the peering connection.
- Edit both routing tables for both subnets containing EC2s you will use for the ping test.


##### 2- Transit Gateway

- For using Transit Gateway, first make sure to remove the peering connection from the routing tables to get rid of any black holes.
- When creating the Transit Gateway you will find the attachment type desired.
- After choosing the VPC, a new list will appear for you to choose which subnets to work with, as it's for subnet level.
- Edit the route tables after creating the Transit Gateway, make sure to set the *Destination* as the other CIDR Network, & the *Target* as the Transit Gateway.
 
## VPC Endpoints

### Why need them illustration

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516215126.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516215953.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516220822.png]]

### Gateway endpoint & Interface endpoint

![Pasted image 20221125233953](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204101037-8f3f1291-85e8-4614-b00a-a6975358256a.png)
Used for making applications/instances on private subnets connect to AWS services "as S3 Buckets" without a public end point "no internet access".
*ie:* Traffic going from the private subnet to the service does not go through the internet.
- They are ``virtual devices, that are redundant, scalable, & highly available.
- They allow VPC workloads to connect to supported AWS services without leaving the AWS network, thus no need of NAT instances or gateways.
- It has two types : **Gateway or Interface Endpoints***. "usage of each is according to the service."
*Note:* Only S3 & DynamoDB uses Gateways Endpoints, while services inside the VPC use Interface Endpoints.



##### 1- Gateway Endpoints

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516222112.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516222112.png]]

- **Set as a target in the subnet's routing table**
- Redundant & highly available.
- Only one is required per VPC, but each gateway reaches a service
  so You can configure multiple gateways for different services.
- Region Specific.
- No Security Groups.


##### 2- Interface Endpoints
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516223643.png]]

- It's an interface with a private IP Address in a subnet you choose.
- Services that use this endpoint are known to be *Powered by AWS Private Link*.
- Supports IPv4
- Regional Specific.
- **You can add Security Groups.**
- **No Routing is done**, instead it's **based on DNS** resolution to the service.
*Note:* Remember to **create an IAM Role** for the instance with the **permissions required for dealing with services**, otherwise the endpoint will ensure the connection but the commands won't work.

### Controlling Access to services with VPC Endpoint Policies

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250516223932.png]]

- By default, an endpoint allows full access to the designated service.
- *Endpoint Policies* can be used to control who access what in the designated service
- The Policies exists for both kinds of endpoints.
*Notice:* No NACLs or Security Groups, its done through permission policies.

### Accessing VPC Endpoints from Remote Networks using Proxy Server

![Pasted image 20221126164858](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204101045-925a738f-511c-4afc-bd05-df4422f2c897.png)

One of the uses of Proxy servers, is that if we created it in a private subnet & connect the subnet with VPN or DX connection to an on-premises site, the proxy can be used to redirect the traffic from the site to the VPC Endpoints, making AWS services reachable from the site without internet traffic.
## IPv6 Egress-only internet Gateway
All IPv6 addresses are public, thus any IPv6 address you need is allocated from AWS not you.
*What if you need a private instance allocated with IPv6?*
- Egress Only Gateway allows outbound IPv6 traffic, but prevents initiated inbound traffic from the internet to the VPC, so it was designed to satisfy private subnets requirements.
- It's attached to the VPC, & created under the VPC Console.
- It's stateful.
- cannot be associated by a security group. But notice that if this is required, the security groups & NACLs support IPv6, so you can add security roles as desired.
- It's assigned through the routing table as the target.
- A routing table can have both IPv4 & IPv6.

## VPC Flow Logs
It's a feature allowing logging to the IP traffic going to & from the network interfaces in the VPC.
- It provides Source IP/Port, Destination IP/Port, and status (Accepted or Rejected).
- The logs doesn't contain the data or a description of it.
- You can create a flow log per VPC, per subnet, or per ENI "Elastic Network Interface".
- Flow logs can be published to Amazon CloudWatch logs, *or* Amazon S3 Buckets.
- To create a flow log for any of the 3 levels, it's created in the Console under the desired level as in picture.

## Hybrid Cloud Connectivity

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250522130140.png]]
### VPN
Connecting a corporate data center to an AWS private subnet is done via static or dynamic routing. This is done using a *Customer Gateway* for the corporate level, & *VGW* for the cloud level.
- It uses IPSec to establish a secure connection.
	Internet Protocol Security "IPSec" is a secure network layer protocol suite that can authenticate & encrypt data packets between host & gateway.responsiblity
- Internet-based connection, so quality & latency depends on the internet traffic.
- Route propagation between implied router and VGW, it makes implied router has knowledge of the available connection to remote site so if it need something from there it can use the VGW 
- Routing is either static or dynamic.
- VPN encryption scope is not end-to-end encryption. Its site to site from a gateway to gateway when the data is received its not the VPN responsibility any more  
- The VGW IP address the corporate will connect to is public IP address, & the customer gateway IP address is also public.
- The customer gateway is the side that initiates connection.
- After initiating, two public IP addresses are assigned to the VGW "Not highly available as the customer gateway still has one IP address".

![Pasted image 20221127041838](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204120149-88bccdbf-dec0-4aed-b6d3-344034a5dbac.png)

If customer gateway is behind NAT it must be NAT traversal 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250522131147.png]]
#### VPN setup on Console
- Done under the VPC Console, VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (VPN) tab.
- You will notice that you have the option to create customer gateway, this is not a creation of course but it's defining the customer gateway that already exists on the corporate side.
![Pasted image 20221127042608](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204120154-aa970bbd-3956-46d5-bc99-08aba0b26601.png)
- Choose the option create virtual private gateway, to setup your VGW.
- The created VGW is detached, go to actions & attach it to a VPC.
![Pasted image 20221127042930](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204120171-02a3c6f5-0f1c-46f8-bf90-97b4d63d5992.png)
- Choose Site-to-Site VPN Connections, & create your VPN as desired.
- Download the configuration file & send it to the corporate to set up the customer gateway, as it is the one that initiates the connection not the VGW.

### AWS Direct Connect "DX"
- Requires an AWS Router, that is assigned to the internet provider in the customer country.
- the sub interfaces between the corporate & the ISP uses VLANs.
- Only Dynamic Routing is supported.
- Requires virtual interfaces "VIF"
- Private VIF is for VPC (VGW) connections, & public VIF is for AWS public endpoints "for services".
- Provides low latency & consistent performance.
- Supports link aggregation up to 4 "Using multiple links as one logical link for higher speed & bandwidth".
- Customer can request a dedicated connection of speed 1-10Gbps.
- Customer can request a hosted connection with starting speed 50Gbps.

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250522132919.png]]

##### DX High availability options
DX Connection is not cost efficient, so setting up multiple DX links for high availability might not be the best option.
- You can use VPN connection as your high availability solution, this is obviously is not fault tolerant.
For higher fault tolerance "no economic limitings":
- You can use multiple DX links.
- You can use multiple DX links & multiple customer gateway.
![Pasted image 20221127055212](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204120182-89f63cb9-af37-444f-8a23-d9f4b00132ea.png)
*Note:* Remember that all of the connections after the DX router in the ISP cage is managed by AWS & stated as redundant & highly available. Thus no editing in these connection shall be considered.
##### AWS Direct Connect Speeds & Link Aggregation Groups 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250522134734.png]]
#### Direct Connect Gateway
DX is a link is bound to a specific region according to direct connect location, So I Want to connect to one of my VPC in another region I can't do that with the Private VIF provided in the current Region. Customer can use VPN connection after the DX router to reach the VGW assigned to the VPC in the other region makes an encrypted & secure connections again, As long as Iam using Public VIF because it provide access to all public aws endpoints without internet. So any public AWS endpoint can be reached without internet by **this work around until Direct connect gateway was made**

Direct Connect Gateway allows reaching any VGW in the account, using a single ***private VIF***.
It can associate either with VGWs in VPCs, or with a transit gateway that has multiple VPC attachments in one region.
*Note:* **DX Gateway won't establish any connection between the VPCs & each other.** 
*Note:* *Although DX is only used by a corporate but its not encrypted and its not private data is sent in plain text so we use DX over IpSec, so its not secured by default*
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250522135039.png]]

##### Multiple Region DX Connections
DX Gateway can be associated with a transit gateway, so no multiple DX links will be needed across different regions. A ***Transit VIF*** will be needed for Transit Gateways connections "after the ISP as the public & private VIF".
![Pasted image 20221127070202](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/204120189-e399b014-7919-48f8-93fb-639a8350e238.png)
*Note:* All kinds of DX connections are not considered secure "although the data link is dedicated to the customer", as the data is not encrypted. This can be overcome by using IPSec upon the DX connection, as stated before in Part 1.


# Part 3: EC2 Deep Dive

## EC2 Instance Families & Types
![Pasted image 20221127213655](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047355-6e6c2290-7c89-43b1-bbf4-2085253b34ad.png)
![Pasted image 20221128052220](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047372-c5c2ce67-623b-4c10-a90c-306641df232e.png)
*Note:* Burstable bandwidth instances are instances that give credits if the I/O operations were below limit for a month, these credits stretches the limit of the I/O operations per month until you run out of credits.

## Instances Lifecycle & Billing
Instances are billable in three states, either running, rebooting, or stopping for Stop-Hibernate, the other states are not billed for.
![Pasted image 20221128052745](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047417-827fbc81-bcbf-4194-be4b-eeabacc22354.png)
*Note:* ***Stop-Hibernate*** state is a freeze state not a complete shutdown, RAM content, Instance ID, Processes running, private IP addresses and EBS root & data volumes are preserved until the restart.
Hibernated instances are not billable, except for EBS volumes & applied Elastic IP addresses.  
It's used to pre-warm applications that take a long time to boot, to make DR backup site ready to be used in case of disaster.
Not all instances support Stop-Hibernate.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html#hibernating-prerequisites 

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250522144204.png]]
## Instance Metadata
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250522144442.png]]

It's data about the instance, & can be used to conigure or manage the instance.
- To view an EC2 instance metadata, connect to the EC2 & use one of these commands:
	- GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
	- Curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
- To view a specific metadata parameter, for example to view local hostname:
	- GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname/
	- Curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname/
![Pasted image 20221129051321](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047460-0c0adc0f-37d4-4074-bfa3-e706aa717f4f.png)

## Instance User Data
It's a data supplied by the user at the instance launch in the form of script to be executed during instance boot.
- It's limited to 16Kb in size.
- User data can be changed after stopping the instance.
- User data is not encrypted, so don't include passwords or sensitive data in user data scripts.
- Can be retrieved using http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
- User data scripts Runs when an EC2 instance is created once only will not run when rebooting the instance, to execute the user data at every launch visit https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/execute-user-data-ec2/
*Note:* AWS does not charge for read requests for user data.
![Pasted image 20221129052557](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047481-ef3113dc-ce8e-4bc4-a81e-85cd0d33d012.png)

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250522144658.png]]
## Instance Purchasing / Launch Types
##### 1- On-Demand
- Most expensive, billable for each second for instances that you launch.
- Used for short duration jobs.
##### 2- Reserved Instances 
- Prepaid.
- High savings up to 75% discount compared to on-demand.
- 1 or 3 years commitments. 
- Can be zonal (per AZ) or Regional scoped.
- It has two types:
	***- Standard RIs***: Higher discounts (up to 75%), & can only modify the size of the instance not the family.
	***- Convertible RIs:*** Lower discounts (up to 54%), & can modify or exchanged with other convertible RIs. 
##### 3- Scheduled Reserved Instances
- Prepaid.
- Up to 54% discount.
- 1 year commitment.
- Upfront purchase instance capacity for **recurring** daily, weekly, or monthly schedule.
##### 4- On-demand Capacity Reservation 
- No commitment, & can be cancelled
- Reserving a specific on-demand instance type capacity in a specific AZ.
##### 5- Spot Instances ($)
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250524095619.png]]
- Cheapest up to 90% savings.
- Utilizes AWS's unused EC2 instances. 
- Can be interrupted.
- Request is on one AZ/subnet.
- Availability is not guaranteed when you need it.
- Launches the instance when the market price meets the required, & terminated if the market price exceeded the price customer required.
- Used for applications that doesn't have strict requirements & can be interrupted.
- Default interruption behavior is terminating the instance, this can be changed for EBS-backed spot instances to stop or hibernate. This doesn't apply to spot blocks.
- There are two types of requests for spot instances:
	***- One Time:*** The request remains active until fulfilled, request expires, or gets cancelled.
	***- Persistent:*** The request remains active until it expires, or you cancel it even if the instance is fulfilled. 
- Aside from spot instances there are:
	***- Spot Blocks:*** Spot blocks will likely not to be terminated upon launching, *used with finite duration's* "few hours work". Request is on one AZ/subnet.
	***- Spot Fleet:*** used to launch a fleet of spot & optional on-demand instances, it uses instance pools & can maintain target capacity & allocation strategies, *used with optional on-demand instances* for work that requires on-demand instances but increasing the instances might be a desired option "As for doing the work faster". Request is on one  or more AZ/subnet.
![Pasted image 20221203142109](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047512-01d04fe2-00e3-4164-ba95-27452f71d256.png)
**Spot Blocks and Spot Fleets are created from spot request Page**, and the normal spot instance is created from the EC2 page 


##### 6- Saving Plan
- Prepaid.
- 1 or 3 years commitment for a specific amount of usage
- Commitment for on-demand launches.
- up to 72% savings.
##### 7- Dedicated Hosts (Bare-Metal Host)
- Pay for a fully dedicated physical host.
![Pasted image 20221130194918](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047556-0184b5a5-5086-41fd-82f5-39259984a857.png)
##### 8- Dedicated Instances
- Pay by the hour for instances that run on a **dedicated single hardware.** They are launched on a single tenant hardware(host) not on dedicated hosts 
- They(Instances) can share the host hardware with other non-dedicated instance of the same account, but not its not used as a shared host the hardware in this case its called Dedicated Single-Tenant Hardware 



Setting dedicated hosts/instances in Console:
![Pasted image 20221203212845](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047619-8af67315-aab9-4598-9772-5019ca6fa514.png)

## EC2 Placement Groups
By default, AWS EC2 service tries to launch instances spread apart to avoid a major impact in case of a failure. 

Placement groups can be used to allow customers to influence how their instances are placed to meet the application needs.

Depending on the type of workload, there are three different ways to launch a placement group.
##### 1- Cluster Placement Groups
- Instances are placed in a Single AZ
- Low node-to-node latency for inter-node communications. 
- Use enhanced networking instances.
- Good for High performance computing (HPC) which requires inter-instance low latency and high speed. 
- **Single AZ has a huge cost advantage at the risk of no high availability "Communications between different AZ instances are billed".**
##### 2- Partition Placement Groups
- Instances are launched in different logical partitions (up to 7 per AZ). 
- Each partition is launched in a separate rack/server.
- One or more AZs in one region.
- Ideal for HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra Database "BigData applications".
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250524102054.png]]
##### 3- Spread Placement Groups
- Each instance is placed in a different rack (up to 7 per AZ).
- One or more AZS.
- Used for applications with a small number of critical instances that need to be separated from each other.

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250524102103.png]]


#Billing
## EC2 Billing
1- Across AZS in the same VPC: Chargeable both ways .
2- Across peered VPCS: Chargeable both ways.
3- Between Instances, Same AZ using Elastic or Public IPs: Chargeable both ways.
4- Between Instances, Same AZ using Private IPv4 IPs: Free.
5- Outbound to the Internet: **Chargeable at Regional rate.**
6- Inbound to an AWS region from the Internet or another region: Free.
7- Outbound from a Region to another region: Chargeable at **Regional rate.**

![Pasted image 20221203203448](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047786-63335c7d-d364-4fd8-976d-8e56f671513f.png)

#CloudWatch
## EC2 Monitoring & Check ups
### EC2 Status Check
Status Checks for EC2 done by AWS to assure performance promised to the customer.
##### 1- EC2 System Status Check:
- Is about monitoring and detecting issues needing AWS's involvement to fix. 
- As host hardware or software problems, network connectivity problems or system power.
- Is performed every minute "The result of the check is either Ok, or Impaired".
##### 2- EC2 Instance Status Check:
- Monitors and detects issues that require the customer's involvement to fix.
- As misconfigured startup configurations, or exhausted memory. 
- It is checked every minute by default.
- Only checks for issues, doesn't get resolved by AWS "As the instance is created by the customer".

### EC2 Monitoring using CloudWatch
##### 1- Basic Monitoring
- By default, Amazon EC2 sends metrics to CloudWatch every 5 minutes. 
- free of charge. 
##### 2- Detailed Monitoring
- Customer can enable detailed monitoring whereby EC2 service sends the metrics to CloudWatch every minute.
- Detailed monitoring is chargeable.

*Note:* Customer can configure CloudWatch to react automatically to failed checks:
- setting CloudWatch Alarm Actions to automatically stop, terminate, reboot or recover EC2 instances.
***Recover action can only be done for System Status check*** related failures. ***Reboot action is more suitable for Instance Status Check*** related failures.
- Customer can also use CloudWatch Events to respond automatically to events such as application availability issues or resource changes.

*Note:* Pay attention to what is NOT sent by default to CloudWatch. For example, Memory utilization and disk space utilization are key metrics required for monitoring, but not sent by default (require custom metrics).

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250524105734.png]]

CloudWatch Events ---> Event Bridge 
## EC2 Instance-Store
- Instance store volumes provide temporary block-storage.
- It is ideal for temporary storage of data that changes frequently. For example, Buffers and caches, Scratch data, Temporary content.
- Some instance types include instance store volumes by default (ex. i3, i3en). 
- Instance store volumes such as those on the i3 & i3en Instances can be used for high IOPS "Input/Output operations per second" OLTP databases, relational DBs and non-relational DBs.
- They can provide millions of IOPS, while EBS has a maximum limit of 64000 IOPS.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/storage-optimized-instances.html

The architecture of Instance Store will compensate for its volatile storage nature, since if its a DB cluster if one fails others will work and as long as the operations and state is saved regulary in intervals we can compensate for the volatile nature of instance store and use its high speed input output 

## Elastic Block Store (EBS)
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250527153621.png]]

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250524110915.png]]
- EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted, external block storage devices. 
- EBS volume data is replicated across multiple servers in the same availability zone (AZ).
- An EBS volume attaches to a single EC2 instance at a time ***(Except for the Multi Attach Provisioned IOPS)***, this happens through the AWS network. 
- Multi Attach EBS volumes allow up to 16 instances per volume, & cannot be used as boot/root volume, only for data volumes. Exclusive only for some instances "Provisioned IOPS instances".
- Both the instance and the EBS volume must be in the same AWS AZ.
- Elasticity in EBS Volumes lets us dynamically modify the size, performance, and volume type of the Amazon EBS volumes without detaching them. Size can be increased not decreased.
### EBS Types

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250524113316.png]]
##### 1- Provisioned IOPS (io1)
- Used Cases:
	- Large IOPS intensive workloads that require consistent performance.
	- Large production databases.
- Cost: Highest
- Orientation: IOPS
##### 2- General Purpose (gp2) 
- Used cases:
	- General workloads.
	- Small Databases.
	- Dev/Test environments.
	- Virtual Desktops.
	- Workloads performing small, random I/O.
- Cost: Higher
- Orientation: IOPS
##### 3- Throughout Optimized (st1)
- Used Cases:
	- Large, sequential I/O workloads such as Amazon EMR, Big Data, ETL, data warehouses, and log processing.
	- Streaming workloads requiring consistent, fast throughput "transfer speed" at a low price.
- Cost: Low
- Orientation: Throughout
##### 4- Cold HDD (sc1)
- Used Cases:
	- Large, sequential cold- data workloads.
	- Throughput-oriented storage for large volumes of data that is infrequently accessed.
	- Scenarios where the lowest storage cost is important.
- Cost: Lowest
- Orientation: Throughout

#### Volume Actions:
![Pasted image 20221205191105](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047952-88c3a0be-a1fb-42b4-9035-e1547836d383.png)

### EBS Snapshots
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250527153744.png]]

Can be manual or scheduled, the snapshots go to an S3 bucket in the same region, but can be copied to another region if desired.
##### Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250527154412.png]]

A total solution for creating, deleting, and retaining EBS volume snapshots. 
-  You can configure snapshot lifecycle policies to carry the required EBS snapshot tasks.
- A DLM policy can snapshot a single volume or multiple volumes attached to an EC2 instance. 
- A DLM Policy uses resource tags to identify the volumes it needs to work on. 
- You can also automate EBS snapshots with CloudWatch events, but that is for individual EBS volumes.
#### Snapshot Actions:
![Pasted image 20221205192326](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206047986-ad1be682-6d34-42ca-ae62-0031b10d1872.png)

*Note:* Upon restoring a snapshot to a volume, the volume must be equal to or larger than the original snapshot volume size.
*EX.* A snapshot of a volume of 8Gb containing data of 3Gb "5Gb free space", when restoring or copying to a new volume, the new volume must be ≥ 8Gb.

### Copying EBS Snapshots 
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250527155002.png]]
### EBS Encryption
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250527154449.png]]
Amazon EBS uses KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) to generate data (encryption) keys to encrypt and decrypt data on EBS volumes. 
- EBS Currently supports symmetric keys only.
- Data is encrypted on the host of the EC2 instance. This means data in-transit to an encrypted EBS volume is also encrypted "encrypted all the way".
- Using AWS CMK is fully managed by AWS unlike customer CMK we are responsible for key rotation, who can and who can't use it , can audit who used it..
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption
![Pasted image 20221204204548](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206048024-0547319f-f1ec-4f5e-8a4d-603bde1920a6.png)
### Encrypting a volume using a CMK:
- When we encrypt a volume using CMK, its snapshots, volumes restored from its snapshots, and copies of the snapshots are all encrypted.
- There is no direct way of changing the encryption status of a volume or a snapshot.
- We cannot change the CMK key used to encrypt an existing encrypted volume or snapshot.
- However, we can work around these restrictions with copy and create volume actions.
	- Encrypting and unencrypted EBS :
		- 
	- unencrypting  an encrypted EBS volume :
		- 
![Pasted image 20221205010658](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206048105-2f61b935-1f41-404f-a05f-6f8c91b2a430.png)
*Note:* We can enable EBS Encryption region-wide which will encrypt all current & future volumes, snapshots & copies of snapshots.

### Sharing EBS Snapshots
Snapshots by default have permissions set to private & can only be viewed by the account. 
***V.Imp.NOTE:*** If we want to share an snapshot with an account in a different region, we need to copy it to that region first.

##### Unencrypted snapshots:
- Snapshots can be shared with all AWS community by modifying permissions to public. 
- Snapshots can be shared with select AWS accounts (permission needs to be private). 
##### Encrypted snapshots:
-  Can't be shared as public snapshots. 
- Can only be shared with select accounts.
- The receiving accounts must be given ****permissions*** on the CMK used to encrypt the shared snapshot "not the key, as the key don't leave the KMS to be downloaded as mentioned before".
- An encrypted snapshot that was encrypted by the default CMK "AWS-managed CMKs (*aws/service_name*)" cannot be shared.
![Pasted image 20221205192100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206048254-23c21bf8-f24b-42b5-a5db-e973fd54e70f.png)

## AMIs & Golden AMIs, Creating AMI From an EBS-Backed EC2 Instance
(AMI: Amazon Machine Images. *ex:* Linux image)

After launching an instance and customizing it; customer creates his own AMI, which can also be called a Golden AMI.
- *ie.:* Golden AMIs are customized AMIs.
- The custom AMI includes snapshots of all attached EBS volumes and they get stored in S3.
- This comes in handy when taking a snapshot, the snapshot will include the basic AMI, plus all the configurations & customizations required for reinstallation.
##### Copying Accounts
- We can copy an AMI within the same region or across AWS regions. 
- We can copy AMIs with encrypted snapshots and change the encryption status during the copy process.
- AMIs from the marketplace (with billing product codes) and Windows AMIs can't be copied to another account. 
	To work around that, launch an instance from the AMI, then create an AMI from that EC2 instance.
##### Sharing AMIs Between Accounts
- When sharing an AMI that has encrypted volumes, we need to share the CMKs used to encrypt those volumes' snapshots.
- If we want to share an AMI with an account in a different region, we need to copy the AMI to that region first.
- Sharing an AMI does not change its ownership. The owning account is charged for the storage of the AMI.
*Note:* Notice that the AMI images is treated the same way as EBS volumes when sharing & copying. This is also true in the AWS Console.

### Creating Custom AMI Image from EC2 Console:
![Pasted image 20221205224425](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206048309-eaa7aa65-9b56-45cf-86c7-4019305f773d.png)
*Note:* When creating an AMI image, it's registered automatically in AWS, **Deregistration** is required first before deletion.

## RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
It's combining multiple volumes & using them as one volume, either for redundancy or performance, & can be used to increase number of IOPS.
- EBS volumes support all RAID types. 
- RAID is performed at the OS level Software. 
- RAID volumes are not recommended by AWS to be used as root/boot volumes.
### RAID Types
##### 1- RAID 0
- Highest IOPS performance among all RAID types.
- Resulting IOPS is the sum of individual IOPS for all volumes.
- No redundancy/mirroring.
- Failure of any volume means failure of the entire array.
##### 2- RAID 1
- NO IOPS performance enhancement.
- Redundant since the same data is written to all volumes.
##### 3- RAID 10
- Combines the benefits of RAID 0 and RAID 1.
- Provides redundancy and performance enhancements.

## AWS Batch
AWS Batch is a fully managed service that simplifies running batch jobs "recurring Jobs" of any scale across multiple availability zones within a region.
- Regional Scale
- It plans, schedules, and executes the batch computing workloads and provisions the optimal quantity of compute required. 
- Customers do not have to run or maintain servers or schedulers. 
- It can scale to hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs. 
- Use cases include digital media rendering, drug screening, and post trade analysis.

# Part 4: Elastic Load Balancing & Auto Scaling Deep Dive

## Target Groups, Listeners, & Health Checks
Load Balancer is a REGIONAL construct, cannot create load balancers for applications across multiple regions.

##### How it works ?
ELB Load Balancer is an EC2 instance with the load balancing software, launched in an AWS-Created VPC called VPC ELB.
It reaches the instances in customer VPC with an AWS-Created ENI called ENI-ELB in customer VPC. This means that the customer subnet must have available IP addresses in range for the ENI-ELB. 
It deals with the private IP address given too the ENI-ELB.
![Pasted image 20221206024324](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206048344-82b16614-2089-4f7c-8fd8-e6b82c587080.png)

### Load Balancer Types
##### 1- Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
- Backend EC2 Instances
- Applicable on all layers, but old & not recommended by AWS anymore
##### 2- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Applicable upon Layer 7 "Applications layer" 
- Targets can be EC2 Instances, IP addresses, Lambda Function
##### 3- Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- Applicable upon Layer 4 "Network layer" 
- Targets can be EC2 Instances, IP addresses, Lambda Function
- Highest Performance for load balancers "only for layer 4".
*Note:*  Load balancers applicable on IP Addresses allow the ability to apply load balancing for on-premises sites as well, by using their IP address.

### Target Groups
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529151249.png]]
It's a logical grouping of targets, targets can be EC2 Instances, IP addresses, or ECS microservice.
- A target is an endpoint registered with the ***ALB/NLB*** as part of a target group.
- IP addresses can be used to add targets that are instances in a peered VPC, on- premises servers, and AWS resources that can be addressed by IP and port. 
- ALB/NLB can route traffic to multiple target groups.
- A target can be registered with a target group multiple times using different ports.

### ELB Listeners
A listener is the process that checks for connection requests to the ELB nodes, Multiple listeners can be configured on the ELB.
- On the CLB, listeners are configured frontend towards the clients, and backend towards backend instances.
- On ALB/NLB, frontend is the same as CLB, but backend is configured at the target group.
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529151422.png]]

### ELB Health Checks
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529151634.png]]
A load balancer decouples the application layer by concealing the failure in one tier from other tiers.
- Health checks are used by the elastic load balancer to track the health and responsiveness of the backend compute.
- Health check ports and thresholds are configurable.
- This way, ELB increases the availability of the application.
- If no healthy backend computes were found, the traffic won't be dropped, but will be sent to all computes instead "in hope of a response".

### Target Groups & Listeners Rules
A rule can be given to each listener to specify a specific job "*ex:* specific Port".
- Any listener has a default rule.
- The default rule is sending any traffic to the target group port.
- Customer can define different rules.
- Rules are applied from top to bottom in the console.
- If no rule were to be satisfied the traffic is sent to the default rule.
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529152226.png]]
![Pasted image 20221206035943](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206048412-46195733-e291-4b71-ae3c-e43ba570e8fb.png)

## ELB is on the EC2 Dashboard in Console:
![Pasted image 20221206035509](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/206048439-b7790ab2-1d37-4055-ab68-262a01aec959.png)

## Cross-Zone Load Balancing
Applying the traffic equally upon instance level, instead of node level.
*ie:* Applies distribution of traffic among different AZs instead of among EC2 instances in the same EZ only.
- Ensures higher availability & fault tolerance.
- Enabled by default in CLB.
- Enabled by default in ALB.
- Disabled by default & Chargeable in NLB.
![Pasted image 20221207153739](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480136-fb69acfa-8240-4dfd-b39c-882e06f426f5.png)

## Connection Draining
Suppose some EC2 instances is required to be deregistered from the ELB for troubleshooting, what happens to the sessions on these instances.
When a backend instance or a target from a target group attached to an ELB is deregistered from the ELB:
- ELB stops sending any further traffic to this instance/target.
- ELB waits for a deregistration (or connection draining) delay, during which in-flight sessions through that instance/ELB are given time to finish.
- Deregistration delay is 300 seconds by default.
- If the deregistration delay is met & the instance still didn't end current sessions, Traffic/Sessions will be dropped.

## ELB High Availability Design For Subnets

- AWS Recommends using ELB across minimum of 2 AZ.
- If the ELB is an internet-facing ELB, the enabled subnets have to be public subnets "subnets with routes accessing the internet" for the ENI.
- Backend or targets can be in public or private subnets.
- *Note:* NAT Gateways can be used in HA Design for private subnets accessing the internet.
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529154850.png]]



## ELB - Security Groups

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529155342.png]]

![Pasted image 20221207162035](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480187-a0c60fbb-ddad-4436-ae9d-b9718e6bcd43.png)

- Applying security Groups to the ELB can be done.
- Security Groups are not applicable on NLB.
- The concept is setting the security groups as source instead of using IP addresses.
- Security groups are stateful.
- Make sure that the NACLs allow subnets communications
- AS the NLB cannot have security groups, it only have the NACL of the subnet. Instead of setting the security group as source, the NLB Nodes IP/Subnet range is set.
- Notice the security groups of each of the ELBs & the instances:
![Pasted image 20221207162035](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480215-800168e1-dab4-4158-bdfe-84cc761f1d38.png)

## ELB & Digital Certificates
X.509/TLS/SSL or Digital Certificates is a digital file that is used to certify the ownership/binding between a public cryptographic key to an entity that must be named in the subject field. 
- The entity can be a person, organization, web entity, or a software distribution.
- The certificate includes the public key and information about who issued it (the Certificate Authority).
- Certificate Authority (CA) ensure that people cannot claim others' IDs by issuing fake digital certificates.
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529161234.png]]
![Pasted image 20221207170045](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480254-e113fc46-874d-41d2-ab36-8dccb3e4963f.png)

![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529161310.png]]
### Digital Certificates on ELB
ELB deals with the traffic, so it must have the certificate the clients will require for connection.
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250529161459.png]]
##### CLB
- Can do both SSL & HTTPS "Layer 4 & Layer 7".
- Can have one certificate.
##### ALB
-  Can do HTTPS only "Layer 7".
-  Can have multiple certificates.
##### NLB.
- Can do only SSL "Layer 4"
-  Can have multiple certificates.

#### SSL Offloading
SSL offloading is when the ELB will terminate TLS/HTTPS sessions from clients then establish clear or unencrypted sessions to the backend.
- Encryption is done on the Client to ELB side.
- Backend instances/targets do not have to process TLS/HTTPS handshake and the associated secure sessions overhead.
- Meaning that the backend won't need encrypted traffic.
- Termination is done on the ELB.
![Pasted image 20221207172807](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480291-df051a21-8a4f-4f4b-ab12-a86beb29dc32.png)

#### TCP Passthrough
TCP Passthrough is when the backend is responsible for termination of TLS/HTTPS sessions from clients.
- End-to-end in-transit (in-flight) encryption is required between the client and EC2 backend instances or targets.
- ELB should not be involved in any SSL negotiation (decrypting and re-encrypting traffic).
- Meaning no encryption is done on the client to ELB or the ELB to backend sides. 
- Termination is done on the backend.
![Pasted image 20221207173455](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480326-ced7262c-6114-4ca0-ae1d-07118ea62a8c.png)

#### Server Name Indication "SNI"
SNI or Server Name Indication is an extension to TLS.
- Clients that support SNI can indicate which domain they are trying to connect to during the handshake.
- Servers supporting SNI can read this HTTP header and respond with the correct domain certificate.
- It's not a DNS service, it only provides the correct certificate from multiple certificate.
- Supported by ALB, NLB "as they can hold multiple certificates".
![Pasted image 20221207174224](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480351-83371145-e99f-4824-8b54-cdbf71821f78.png)

## ELB & Client IP Address
Normally, ELB nodes will send their own IPv4 address as source IP address in the packets forwarded. Suppose it's required for the applications to be able to know the actual client IP addresses, not that of the ELB Node.

The following ways used to provide the client IP address to the backend:
##### X-Forwarded
- For at layer 7 listeners.
- CLB & ALB.
- Client IP is in put in Header.
##### Proxy Protocol
- At layer 4 listeners.
- CLB & NLB.
- Client IP is put in the proxy data not the Header.
- If the Instance IDs were used in the target groups, NLB automatically preserves client IP addresses when the instances are registered to their target groups using instance IDs.
*ie.* Proxy Protocol is not needed in NBL if the instances were defined using instance ID, but is used in case of IP addresses or Lambda functions defining of instances in the target group.
![Pasted image 20221207182608](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480394-9beb1df5-2274-4fbd-80af-b3d76d7d14b3.png)

## ELB Monitoring & Logging
Monitoring ELB in AWS can be achieved by:
- ###### CloudWatch:
	- By default ELB service will send ***metrics*** to CloudWatch every minute if there is traffic flowing through the ELB nodes
- ##### CloudTrail:
	- CloudTrail logs all ***API Calls*** made to ELB APIs.
 - ##### Access Logs:
	 - Provides logs about ***actual traffic, Client IP, Protocol, Port,*** basically about the actual session information. Disabled by default.

## Session Affinity (Sticky Sessions)
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250626145343.png]]
Session stickiness refers to a configuration whereby the ELB will bind a client to a specific backend instance/target.
- This is supported by all ELBs. 
- Session stickiness is not fault tolerant. 
- Used with stateful applications, or applications that can not maintain session state.
- Applied on the target group not the ELB.
*Note:* Stateful applications are applications that stores cache & cookies on the instant, so faulting of the instance means losing of data access.

## Perfect Forward Secrecy
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) helps prevent the decoding of captured encrypted data by unauthorized third parties, even if the private key gets compromised.
- Concept is allowing using changing encryption keys.
- It does that by using session keys that are ephemeral and not stored anywhere.
- Uses Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) Protocol.


## Application Load Balancer (ALB)
-  supports: HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2 
- Supports Web Application Firewall (WAF): You can use AWS WAF with Application Load Balancer (ALB) to allow or block requests based on the rules in a web access control list (web ACL). 
- Internet-facing ALB supports IPv4 and DualStack. 
- ALB supports WebSockets by default "Server Initiating messages to client".
- ALB supports round robin (default), and least outstanding requests load balancing algorithms
	- Round Robin: Distributes work among targets equally.
	- Least Outstanding Requests: Sends traffic to less stressed instances.

### Path-Based & Host-Based Routing
Supported ONLY for ALB.
An Application Load Balancer supports specific content routing traffic to a specific target group based on:
- The HTTP path header of the URL.
	``www.example.com/images``
	``www.example.com/videos``
- The HTTP hostname header of the URL.
	``offers.example.com``
	``sales.example.com``
- This is also possible for HTTPS traffic.
![Pasted image 20221207190102](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480515-964acd6b-9953-4fbc-a84b-b57fb3ca3128.png)

### Slow Start Mode
Supported ONLY for ALB.
By default, a registered target starts receiving its full share of requests as soon as it becomes healthy.
- This is a target group level configuration.
- Slow-start mode gives a target time to warm up before receiving the full share of requests.
- During this period, the ALB increases the requests sent to this target gradually towards full share, which happens when the slow-start time ends.


## Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- NLB provides the highest connections speed and lowest latency among all ELBs.
- Supports TCP & UDP load balancing.
- NLB can be assigned an Elastic IP per enabled AZ if desired.
- Access logs, cross-zone load balancing, and delete protection are disabled by default, & chargeable.
- Supports client connections over VPC peering, AWS VPNs and 3rd party VPNs.

### AWS PrivateLink & VPC Endpoints
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250626153447.png]]
- Used with Interface VPC Endpoints.
- AWS PrivateLink-powered services are created in a VPC, also called ***VPC Endpoint Services***.
- Requirement is to have a NLB in the provider VPC and an Interface VPC Endpoint in the consumer VPC. Together, they constitute the Private Link to this service.
- Provider VPC can control via permissions which principals can connect via interface endpoints.

#### AWS PrivateLink & VPC Endpoints High Availability
- High Availability is applied by configuring the NLB and interface endpoints in each AZ in that AWS region.
- Consumers use DNS names for the endpoints to connect to the services. 
- It's advised to enable cross-zone load balancing on the NLB to ensure each NLB node can route to all EC2 instances, but it's chargeable.
![Pasted image 20221207220244](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480562-f13bed65-3e13-4fcb-ab44-3336f64c8118.png)

### Gateway Load Balancer
It is a service that makes it easy and cost-effective to deploy, scale and manage the availability of third-party virtual applications such as Firewalls, Intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems in the cloud.
- Internet traffic goes from the IGW to the Gateway Load Balancer, & the Gateway Load Balancer redirects it to a NLB attached to a target group with the third-party virtual appliances, then after the application ends its work, the Gateway Load Balancer gets the traffic back & sends it to the original destination EC2 Instances.
- Traffic from the instance to internet "response" works the same way.
This is done via routing tables of the subnets.
- Subnet level service & has its own subnet.
![Pasted image 20221207221721](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480598-c441e1c6-99f9-4134-b7d0-bb840062db54.png)

## Load Balancers are under the EC2 Dashboard in Console
![Pasted image 20221210202912](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480632-75dfe0f2-30e4-4cbf-9fd2-5b00f332b4e7.png)


# Part 5: AWS Auto Scaling Deep Dive
AWS Auto Scaling allows for the configuration of automatic scaling for the AWS resources that are part of an application very quickly. 
- Automatic scaling can be configured for individual resources or for applications.
- Auto Scaling can be used with EC2, Spot Instances, DynamoDB, Aurora, Amazon ECS among other services.

Auto Scaling is useful for applications that experience daily or weekly variations in traffic flow such as:
- Cyclical traffic patterns.
- On and Off traffic patterns.
- Variable traffic patterns.

## Application Auto Scaling
Application Auto Scaling is a web service for automatically scaling resources for services beyond Amazon EC2. 
- It can be used with Auto Scaling and EC2 Auto Scaling to scale resources across multiple services including:
	- ECS services 
	- Spot Fleet requests
	- EMR Clusters 
	- AppStream 2.0 fleets
	- Aurora Replicas DynamoDB Read and Write Capacity units
	- SageMaker endpoints
	- Amazon Comprehend

## EC2 Auto Scaling
- It's a Regional service
- It can span multiple Availability Zones in the same AWS Region.
- It integrates with ELB, CloudWatch, and Cloud Trail.
- It is free to use, but customers pay only for EC2 and EBS resources used. 
- ASG will try to balance resources across Availability Zones.
- The EC2 Auto Scaling configuration components are:
	 - ##### An Auto Scaling Group 
		- Is the logical grouping of managed instances.
		- Desired no. is the starting no. of instances to launch.
	- ##### A Launch Configuration (or A Template)
		- The template for instance configurations. 
	- ##### A Scaling Policy (Plan) 
		- Defines the when and how to scale out or in.
![Pasted image 20221207224003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480680-0209af7f-cc18-4f14-9ac8-22739d398533.png)
*Note:* Launch Templates are preferred over Launch Configurations by AWS, as future updates are concerning Launch Templates.

### EC2 Auto Scaling: Launch Templates
Launch Templates serves the same purpose as launch configuration, where it defines the EC2 instance configuration. AWS recommends using it over launch configuration.
However it has the following advantages over launch configurations:
- It can have different versions.
- It allows the use of multiple instance types and can use On-Demand and Spot instances in the same Auto Scaling group.
- We can define a placement group in the template such that instances will be launched in that placement group "Check placement groups in Part3".
This would help achieve the desired scale, cost, and performance.

### EC2 Auto Scaling: Health Checks
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250626164334.png]]
By default the EC2 Auto Scaling service determines if the instance is running or not via EC2 status check, even with ELB applied.
- This can be changed when creating Auto Scaling Group in the console to wait for EC2 status check ***AND*** the ELB health checks.
- If either of the two checks states a negative response, the instance is terminated.
![Pasted image 20221207230640](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480719-52273ba7-8493-4fcf-afef-cbcd4b9f92d8.png)

### EC2 Auto Scaling: Types
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250626164350.png]]
Auto Scaling policy types: 
- ##### 1- Manual
	- This is to maintain a current number of Instances at all times.
	- Manually change the Min/Desired/Max & Attach/Detach instances.
- ##### 2- Cyclic or Schedule Scaling
	- Used with predictable load change to add Instances and remove them after the desired duration (daily, weekly, monthly).
- ##### 3- On-Demand or Dynamic Scaling
	 ![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250626164613.png]]
	- Scaling in response to an alarm/event.
	- CloudWatch monitors metrics and generates alarms for auto scaling to scale out/in.
	- Has 3 types:
		![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250626164832.png]]
		- **Simple Scaling:** A single adjustment up or down in response to the alarm.
		- **Step Scaling:** Multiple Steps/Adjustments depending on different Alarms.
		- **Target Tracking Scaling:** Scale out or in based on a target value for a specific metric.
- ##### 4- Predictive Scaling
	- Combines proactive and reactive scaling.

### EC2 Auto Scaling: Lifecycle Hooks
- Lifecycle hooks enables performing custom actions "such as checking logs" by pausing instances as an auto scaling group launches or terminates these instances.
- When an instance is paused, it remains in a wait state either until the lifecycle action is completed or until the timeout period ends (one hour by default).
![Pasted image 20221208001552](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480740-5be069f5-566e-4da8-9eba-7cbb2ce8bb87.png)

### EC2 Auto Scaling: Cooldown & Warm-up Periods
##### Cooldown Period
- After a scale-out or scale-in activity.
- Is the amount of time Auto Scaling waits after a scale-out or scale-in activity before another scale activity can start. 
- This help ensure that the impact of the scaling activity becomes visible.
##### Instance Warm-up Period
- After a scale out activity.
- Is the amount of time that elapses before a newly launched instance (due to a scale-out activity) begins contributing to CloudWatch metrics.
- Basically to allow new launched instances to start giving impact after fully launching.

### EC2 Auto Scaling: Scale-in Termination Protection
Instances can be protected from being automatically terminated during a scale-in event using Scale-in instance protection.
This setting can be changed at the Auto Scaling Group level.

However, this does not protect the instance from:
- Manual termination. 
- Replacement if it becomes unhealthy.
- Spot instance interruption.

### EC2 Auto Scaling: Termination Policy
Which Instance is to be terminated??

- The AZ with the larger number of EC2 instances is selected first for termination.
- If there is a mix of launch configuration and Launch Template instances, ones with launch configuration are selected first for termination.
- AS terminates the instance with the oldest launch configuration first.
- If they are all the same, AS terminates the one that is closest to billing hour.

# Part 6: SQL-Based "Relational" Databases Services

## Data Types:
![[../Attachments/Pasted image 20250626170852.png]]
#### SQL (Structured Data)
- Data that is ready to be included in a relational database.
- Tabled data is an example.
#### NoSQL (Unstructured Data)
- Data that is ready to be included in a relational database.
- Emails, word processing documents, presentations, audio and video files, webpages are examples.
#### No-SQL (Semi-Structured Data)
- CSV & JSON files.


# *〔1〕RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service)*

*OLTP DB: On-Line Transactional Processing Databases*

It is a fully managed relational DB from AWS.
- Supports MS SQL, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle and Amazon Aurora. 
- Launches inside your VPC. However, you do not have root access or OS access for the DB instances.
- Use self-managed DB (on EC2) if OS control or root access is required.
- RDS integrates with SNS for event notifications.
- Mentioned short notes about RDS in Part 1:
	- RDS Launches the database inside the VPC.
	- It's advised to be put inside a private subnet.
	- A security group can be attached to the RDS database.
	- RDS instance can be launched in a standalone mode "single AZ" or Multi-AZ mode (Primary instances for read/write & Standby RDS instances for instant data replication only).
	- It supports auto scaling.

## Standby DB instance & RDS for Multi-AZ
RDS can be configured for Multi-AZ deployment during or after launch. RDS service creates a standby instance in the same region but in a different Availability Zone.
- For data replication.
- Synchronous/immediate data replication from primary to standby is configured by RDS service.
- CANNOT read or write to the standby instance. 

## RDS Failover for Multi-AZ
Failover means using the Standby DB in case of failier.
Failover maybe triggered when: 
- Primary AZ or Primary DB instance failure.
- Loss of network connectivity to primary DB.
- Compute or Storage failure on primary.
- Patching the primary DB instance OS "As a reboot may be needed".
- The DB instance's server type is changed.
- Manual failover (reboot with failover) on primary.

Applications should use the DNS Hostname of the RDS DB and not the IP addresses. *Why??*
Because when a Standby RDS is used it's set as the primary database, & the original primary DB is set to Standby "exchange roles". 
- So the DNS will redirect to the right IP address after changing.
- Amazon RDS update the standby IP to correspond to the RDS DB Hostname when the primary fails over to the standby.

![Pasted image 20221208005801](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220480933-efd017e4-1df0-4c4b-a294-5886ad46bfbf.png)

## RDS Automated Backup
It's a point-in-time copy of the entire database (DB)
- Taken daily.
- Enabled by default.
- Creates a storage volume snapshot of the entire DB that gets stored in an S3 Bucket ***not owned by the customer***.
- Snapshots are retained for seven days by default (0 to 35 days configurable).
- The automated backup can be used to restore the DB up to five minutes in time.
- If the DB is on Multi-AZ, the backup is taken from the Standby DB instance in order of not affecting the performance of the primary DB.
- Automated DB backups are deleted when the DB gets deleted.

## Manual DB Snapshots
Manual snapshots are the ones manually created during the lifetime of the DB instance. 
- They get stored in S3.
- Manual snapshots do not get deleted automatically when the DB is deleted.
- AWS recommends taking a final snapshot of the DB before deleting it.

## Restoring from Backups
- Restoring happens to a new DB, no overwriting to the old one.
- The DB storage type can be changed during a restore process.
- Automated snapshots can be used to restore to any point-in-time during the retention period of the snapshot. AWS RDS will use the transaction logs to restore up to 5 minutes in time.
- We can restore from a manual snapshot, but we cannot specify a point in time to recover to.

## Copying & Sharing DB Snapshots
##### Copying:
Both automated backups and manual snapshots can be copied.
- In either case the resulting copy is considered a manual snapshot. 
- Copying snapshots can happen within the same or different regions. 
##### Sharing:
Manual encrypted or un-encrypted snapshots can be shared with other accounts.
- Shared snapshots by other accounts can also be copied. 
- Automated backups cannot be shared with other accounts. 
**Workaround:** copy the automated backup into a manual snapshot, then share the copy.

## Scaling RDS: Auto Scaling
Amazon RDS supports storage auto scaling. 
- When enabled, RDS Auto Scaling will automatically scale storage capacity on-demand with zero downtime. 
- Auto Scaling in RDS is storage scaling. 
- It can be enabled on existing or new RDS instances.
- Fully Managed service as stated before.

## Scaling RDS: Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling refers to changing the instance or storage of the same RDS instance.
- Only Scales up, no scaling down.
- Scaling instance type and storage are decoupled, scaling each separately.
*ie.* It is possible to change the database storage volume size or type (Ex. general purpose to Provisioned IOPS to enhance performance). 

## RDS Horizontal Scaling using Read Replicas (Scaling Read Operations)
It's a DB with a replica of the data, & it has a READ ONLY status.
- Allows reading the data without affecting performance of the primary DB.
- Data replication is ***Asynchronous***.
- Can be set up in a Multi-AZ configuration, & the data replication to the Read Replica can happen through the Standby DB instance to enhance performance of the Primary DB even more.
- Can be in a different AZ in the same region or a different region.
- The Read Replica's storage type or instance class can be different from those on the primary DB Instance.
- Can be later used as a primary DB in case of a failure.
- Can be later used as a totally separate DB if needed.

## RDS Encryption
Amazon RDS supports encryption at rest using AWS KMS encryption keys. 
- If encryption is enabled on RDS, the underlying DB storage "EBS volumes", DB logs, automated backups, DB manual snapshots, and Read Replicas will all be encrypted.
- The Read Replica encryption status is like that of the primary.
* Communication between the RDS Client and RDS DB can be TLS/SSL encrypted.

##### Communication between the RDS Client and RDS DB:
- The RDS Server has a digital root certificate.
- Upon creating an RDS DB, the RDS Root Certificate is downloaded on the Primary DB,
- When a Client connects with RDS DB with SSL connection, the DB responds with the RDS Root Certificate.

## Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
Encryption feature for Oracle & MS SQL.
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) is an encryption where data is client-side encrypted before being written to the RDS DB.
- TDE for Oracle and MS SQL can be used simultaneously with RDS encryption at rest.

## RDS Authentication
Connection to RDS is done via username & password.
Another way is using IAM Authentication:
### IAM DB Authentication for MYSQL & PostgreSQL
Used to access MySQL and PostgreSQL RDS databases.
- Authentication is done by an authentication Token (its lifetime is 15 minutes) which can be requested from Amazon RDS.
- IAM user or role has to be configured in the DB with the same name.
- Client to DB must be SSL encrypted.
*ie.* RDS authentication uses two methods, either username & Password, or username & an authentication token.


# *〔2〕Amazon Aurora*
**{{OLTP DB: On-Line Transactional Processing Databases}}**

Aurora is a fully managed relational DB service compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL engines.
- Can provide ***3x PostgreSQL*** and ***5x MySQL performance***.
- A virtual database storage volume that spans multiple AZS.
- Aurora maintains 2 copies of the data per AZ, & in in three AZs.
- No standby instances, substituted by read replicas.
- Up to 15 read-only Aurora replicas in different AZS in the same AWS Region.
![Pasted image 20221208190057](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220481225-c5b649e1-fc6b-4bb8-b9d1-8b644169b667.png)

## Aurora Scaling
Aurora has the following scaling features:
##### Storage Scaling:
- Automatically adjusts the storage size in 10GB increments up to 100TB+.
##### Read Scaling: 
* Up to 15 Aurora Replicas. The Replicas can be placed in Multi-AZs.
##### Aurora Auto Scaling:
- Scales the number of Aurora replicas up and down based on need, up to 15 Replicas. 
##### Instance Scaling:
- We can scale the Aurora instances up or down by modifying the instance type/size.

## Aurora Connection Management & Endpoints
Incase of RDS, one Endpoint was required as there were only connecting to primary or Reading from Read Replicas.

For Aurora DBs, multiple endpoints exists for connecting to them:
##### Cluster Endpoint
- Connects to the Primary Aurora Instance
- .- ID Ex: 
	***mydbcluster.cluster***-123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306
##### Reader Endpoint
- Connects to an Aurora Replica.
- Performs connection load balancing to Replicas.
- ID Ex: 
	***mydbcluster.cluster-ro***-123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306
##### Instance Endpoint
- Connects to a specific Instance
- - ID Ex: 
	 ***mydbinstance***.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306

## Aurora Replicas - Aurora Backup
Aurora Replicas serve as backup replicas.
- It can return the data written by the primary instance in less than 100msec. 
- To increase availability, Aurora Replicas can be used as failover targets. If the primary instance fails, an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance.
- Aurora database supports automated backups and manual snapshots the same way as in Amazon RDS.

## Aurora Infrastructure Security & Authentication
Aurora clusters are launched in a VPC. 
The VPC must have DB subnet groups, with one subnet in each of at least two Availability Zones.
- Security groups are associated with the cluster & can be used to control access to DB.
- Aurora supports TLS/SSL connections to these endpoints. 
- IAM DB authentication can be used with Aurora MySQL as in the case with RDS.
- Aurora APIs are accessible from within a VPC using VPC Interface endpoints "For configuring the service".

## Aurora Encryption
Same way as RDS, Encryption can be enabled on the Aurora cluster
- The database cluster will be encrypted at rest, including the underlying storage volumes. 
- If an Aurora cluster is encrypted, the cluster storage and data, its snapshots, automated backups and Aurora replicas will all be encrypted too.
- We can't change the encryption status of a cluster.
- We can restore from an unencrypted Aurora DB cluster snapshot into an encrypted Aurora DB cluster. 
- A replica's encryption status follows that of the DB cluster.

## Aurora Global DB
- Consists of one read/write cluster primary region & Up to 5 secondary read-only cluster regions.
- Secondary clusters regions can have up to 16 Aurora replicas each, no primary/master instances "15 replicas+1 failover for primary".
- Replication happens using a dedicated replication **physical** infrastructure with latency of less than 1 second.
- Failover is possible in less than one minute.
![Pasted image 20221208210838](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220481268-d8c77a11-c4e1-4dca-aca5-bb592cf5d7fd.png)

## Aurora Cross-Region Replication Options
Using Aurora for cross-regional replications is recommended by AWS & is better than MySQL DBs, because:
- Faster Replication. <1sec
- Less failover time. <1min
- Data transfer charges don't apply, while it's chargeable in case of MySQL DB
- Aurora supports MySQL & PostgreSQL.

## Aurora Cluster Backtracking
Backtracking is simply rewinding your DB cluster to a time you specify without restoring from a backup. Can be used to undo mistakes or explore changes made to the DB cluster.
- This Service is only for Aurora DBs, & not in RDS.
- Can backtrack back and forth.

## Aurora Multi-Master Clusters
Also referred to as multi-writer cluster. It is an Aurora cluster where all instances can handle read/write operations.
- If a writer instance fails, there is immediately another one that takes over without interruption (***Continuous Availability*** which is better than HA).
- Used for applications where we can't afford even a brief downtime.
- Currently, multi-master clusters have many feature limitations compared to single master clusters.

## Aurora Serverless
Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, autoscaling configuration of Amazon Aurora.
- It manages a warm pool "Ready & booted pool" of resources in an AWS region to minimize scaling time.
- Runs on the same architecture as Aurora (provisioned DB clusters).
- Supports TLS/SSL client/app connections.
- It starts and scales compute capacity (DB nodes) per applications' usage and shuts it down when no longer required.
Aurora Serverless clusters can be accessed from within a VPC using two VPC endpoints.

##### Aurora Serverless can be used for: 
- Infrequently used applications (low volume sites).
- New applications when DB instance sizes are unknown.
- Variable or unpredicted workloads.
- Development and test databases. 
- Multi-tenant applications.

## Aurora is under RDS Dashboard on Console

# *〔3〕Amazon RedShift*
**{{OLAP DBs: On-Line Analytical Processing DBs}}**
		*Note:* Analytical DBs has two types:
		- Realtime Analytical DB
		- Historical Analytical DBs

Amazon RedShift is a Database service for analytics collected over a period called historical analytical database.
- Amazon RedShift is a Historical OLAP DB service.

## Data Warehouse
A data warehouse is a collection of data collected from different sources, which then undergoes complex long queries for analytics, business reporting, and visualization purposes.
- A data warehouse is a relational DB "support SQL queries" that is designed for analytics (OLAP) rather then Transaction processing (OLTP).
- On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) is characterized by relatively low transactions volume and very complex queries that involved aggregations.

## RedShift Service
Amazon RedShift is a fully managed data warehouse service (OLAP) in AWS.
- Petabyte Scale, so capable of storing large size of data
- It provides fast querying over structured data using familiar SQL based clients "using ODBC, JDBC connections" and business intelligence (BI) tools "Quicksight, Tableau, etc."".
- Uses columns rather than rows to store data. This is 10x faster than transactions SQL databases.
- Uses advanced compression, and Massive parallel processing of data.
- Despite its high storage ability, it can't take a large data ingestion in real time "stores the data for later analyzing".
- Works in one AZ inside the VPC.
- RedShift is a pay-as-you-go service (no upfront commitments).

## RedShift Availability
- RedShift doesn't support Multi-AZs, snapshots can be used for data recovery.
- Can be single-node or multi-node clusters "in a single AZ". Leader and compute nodes. 
- Clusters are launched in a single AZ. 
- RedShift automatically replicates all data with the cluster. It keeps three copies of the data.
- RedShift can fully recover from a node or component failure.
- RedShift automatically patching and data backup. performs node
![Pasted image 20221210012819](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220481355-9cb78253-44ea-4f68-a91d-768c1c30d8c4.png)

## RedShift concurrency Scaling
Allows RedShift to support virtually unlimited concurrent users and queries while maintaining consistent high performance. 
- This is achieved by automatically adding additional cluster capacity (concurrency scaling cluster) when required.

## RedShift Backup & Restore
RedShift automatically takes incremental backups 
- Snapshots are taken every 8 hours or 5GB of data.
- Restoring from a backup happens to a new cluster in the same or different AZ.
- Manual backups are also possible.
- RedShift can be configured to copy snapshots when they are created to another AWS Region.

## RedShift Data Sources & Security
##### Data Sources: 
- S3 (Parallel reads).
- COPY command (EMR, EC2, DynamoDB).
- Data Pipeline (S3 or DynamoDB).
- Database Migration Service.
##### Security:
- Redshift supports encrypting data at rest (disabled by default).
- Customer can manage their keys through Amazon HSM or use KMS keys.
- Snapshots created from an encrypted Redshift cluster are also encrypted.
- Redshift supports encrypting data in-transit using SSL.

## Redshift WLM & Enhanced VPC Routing
##### Workload Management (WLM)
- Is a way to define a number of query queues such that short running queries are not stuck in queues behind long-running ones.
##### Enhanced VPC Routing
- Forces traffic between your Redshift cluster and S3 to go over a VPC endpoint.

# Part 7: NoSQL-Based Databases Services

# *〔1〕Amazon DynamoDB*
DynamoDB is a fully managed, NoSQL database that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
- OLTP Database.
- Does not support complex joins or queries like SQL databases.
- Supports semi-structured and unstructured data.
- Supports both document "CSV & JSON" and key-value data models.
- It saves data over the optimum number of servers according to the read/write capacity required.
- It has a flexible schema (sometimes referred to as schema-less).
- It uses HTTPS as a transport between application & DB.
- Unlimited scaling without downtime or performance degradation.
- Provides single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.
- It has Multi-Region, ***Multi-Master*** "read & write replicas" features.
- It is a durable database and has built-in backup and restore, in-memory caching, and security features.
- Use cases include mobile, retail, banking, gaming, ad-tech applications and for storing session state data.

## Data Consistency Model
DynamoDB Supports:
##### Eventual Consistency Reads
- Might not reflect the latest data in the table.
- Best read speed.
##### Strong Consistency reads:
- A read returns the latest data.
- Needs waiting time to check all replicas for the data.

Applications reading from DynamoDB tables can specify strong consistency reads.

## DynamoDB Tables & Items
DynamoDB stores data in tables. A table is a collection of data items.
- Each table has an unlimited number of items
- Each item can be up to 400KB in size.
	We can store larger data in an S3 bucket, and store S3 pointers (URLs) in the DynamoDB table items yo get around this.
- An item is a group of attributes.
- An attribute is the fundamental data element in DynamoDB. Attributes are like columns in relational DBs.
- Each attribute has an attribute name and a value or a set of values (key and value).
The table is indexed by a **Primary Key** or a **Composite Key**.
- The primary key gets specified at the table creation time.
- The primary key is an attribute that exists in each item and has a ***unique*** value in each item.
![TestPic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109697567/220481418-8b962bf4-225d-4c80-a147-a953e4070327.png)

## DynamoDB Capacity Units
Billing on DynamoDB is done on RCUs & WCUs:
##### Read Capacity Unit (RCU)
- One RCU represents one Strongly Consistent read/Sec  for an item up to 4KB in size.
- Or two Eventual Consistency reads/Sec  for an item up to 4KB in size.
##### Write Capacity Units (WCU)
- One WCU represents one write/sec for an item up to 1KB in size.

If the read or write request rate exceeds the throughput settings for a table, DynamoDB will throttle them, & drop the request.
*Note:* WCUs are more expensive than RCUs

## DynamoDB Auto Scaling
Uses application autoscaling to adjust the RCUs and/or WCUs for a DynamoDB table as demand increases or decreases.
- It works with CloudWatch and application auto scaling to do the required.
- Customers must configure a scaling policy and define a target utilization to scale the capacity units of the table out or in.
- 

## DynamoDB is a service on Console
